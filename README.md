# lpx_links

lpx_links is a utility to get the direct download links for the additional sample/sound content for Logic Pro X and Mainstage.

- It gets the most current links
- Creates a text file with all the links in them
- Importing the links file into a download manager like the DownThemAll addon for FireFox should work well

Includes Mandatory only list. Thanks to _Matteo Ceruti_ aka [Matatata](https://github.com/matatata) for the idea.
   
### Version  
0.0.10 - adds support to specify Mainstage app to get direct download links for sample/sound content

0.0.9 - fixes issue where the install script attempted to re-download the pkg files 🤦‍

0.0.8 - adds logic to resolve relative parents in download URLs & Readme updates.

0.0.7 - added mandatory file list & refactor of code.

0.0.6 - added version detection. Any version of Logic Pro X should work now.

## Usage

Simply open the terminal and paste one of the commands from below. 

For Logic Pro X use the following command:
```sh  
 cd ~/Downloads; mkdir -p lpx_links/app ; cd lpx_links/app ; curl -#L https://goo.gl/nUrpPi | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 ; ./lpx_links.rb -n Logic
  
```

For Mainstage use the following command:
```sh  
 cd ~/Downloads; mkdir -p lpx_links/app ; cd lpx_links/app ; curl -#L https://goo.gl/nUrpPi | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 ; ./lpx_links.rb -n Mainstage
  
```  
  
To download I recommend using *aria2*
- Download & install - [aria2 ver1.33.0 installer](https://github.com/aria2/aria2/releases/download/release-1.33.0/aria2-1.33.0-osx-darwin.dmg)  

- Then in the Terminal  

To only download the mandatory files (32)
```shell  

aria2c -c --auto-file-renaming=false -i ~/Desktop/lpx_download_links/mandatory_download_links.txt -d ~/Downloads/logic_content
```
To download all the packages
```shell
aria2c -c --auto-file-renaming=false -i ~/Desktop/lpx_download_links/all_download_links.txt -d ~/Downloads/logic_content
```

 - -c tells aria2 to continue/resume downloads
 - --auto-file-renaming=false ensures that files will never be redownloaded if they already exist in the target directory
 - -i is the path to the file with list of downloads
 - -d is the path to where you want the downloaded files

### Install All  
  
To install all the downloaded packages use the following command:  

```sh
 sudo ~/Downloads/lpx_links/install.sh ~/Downloads/logic_content 
```  

> Note: The install script expects a directory containing `.pkg` files as its argument, not a text file with download links.
