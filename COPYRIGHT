## License History

### Original License (Pre-2025)
This project was originally released without an explicit license file, though 
README documentation indicated GPL-3.0 licensing.

### Current License (2025-Present)
**MIT License** - Effective October 1, 2025

## License Change Rationale

The project license was changed from GPL-3.0 to MIT for the following reasons:

1. **Project Nature**: This is a simple utility tool for generating download links,
   not complex software requiring copyleft protection.

2. **Community Alignment**: MIT is the standard license for Ruby gems and better
   aligns with community expectations.

3. **Maximum Compatibility**: MIT allows users to incorporate this tool into any
   project (commercial or private) without licensing concerns.

4. **Contributor Consent**: As the primary author and maintainer (75+ commits),
   David Teren holds the majority copyright and has made this licensing decision.
   All other contributors made minor contributions (1-2 commits each) consisting
   primarily of documentation updates and minor fixes.
